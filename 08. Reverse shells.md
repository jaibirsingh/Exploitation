## Reverse shell
* A type of remote shell where the target connects directly to a listener on the attacker's system
* **Issue**
  * Attacker's IP is loaded to the target machine which is not good in the case a suspicion is raised.
 
* PRACTICAL
* The listener is setup on the attacker's machine

## Cheatsheet
