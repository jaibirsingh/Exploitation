##  Publicly Available Exploits
* Try using just the legitimate and vetted exploit databases:
  * Exploit DB
  * Rapid7
 
* Website that rpovides informastion about latest: "Packet Storm"

## Search using Searchsploit
* In some cases, we may not have access to the online exploits.
* Used in the cases where a stable network connection is not possible
* That's not a bif problem though, as the entire ExploitDB comes pre-packaged with Kali Linux
* These offline modules can be searched using Searchsploit:
  * `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install exploitdb -y` --> To update for any latest modules added to ExploitDB
  * **Where are all the exploits tored offline**
    * `ls -al /usr/share/exploitdb`
    * This will contain two folders:
      * Exploits
      * Shellcodes
     
  * The search can be manually by drilling down to the folder structure on this path but searchsploit makes it easier
  * `searchsploit`  --> Documentation
  * Similar to ExploitDB, we have to update the Searchsploit offline library as well
  * `searchsploit -u`
  * `searchsploit [exploit name]`
  * This should give the title of the exploits avaialable along with the path
  * `searchsploit -m [ID of the exploit in the path shown in above list]` --> The exploit downloaded to your current working directory OR
  * `sudo cp /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/[Path shown in the above list]`
  * The SearchSploit command that can be used to display the Exploit-db URL instead of the EDBID:
    * `searchsploit -w [Service name like vsfptd]`
  * Case-sensitive search --> `searchsploit -c [exploit_name]`
  * Title search --> `searchsploit -t [Any word that could be part of the exploit's title]`
  * Exact search --> `searchsploiot -e [phrase in the exploit name]`
  * General structure:
    * `searchsploit [type of exploit like 'remote'] [platform like 'Windows] [service name like 'SMB', or 'Buffer']`
    * More examples:
      * `searchsploit remote webapps drupal`
      * `searchsploit local windows | grep -e "Windows"`
     
    * **Access the exploitDB online through searchsploit**
      * USe the -w option:
      * `searchsploit remote windows smb -w | grep -e "EternalBlue"`
