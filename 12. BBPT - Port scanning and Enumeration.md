* Another way to know local IP:
  * `cat /etc/hosts`
  * The local IP address is on  with the label: `demo.ine.local`
  * `nmap -T4 -PA -sC -sV -O [IP] -oX [Output file name]` --> -oX for XML so that it can be imported to msfconsole. Afterwards look into each port and check in the browser , if not clear, what's running on the these ports.
  * 'msfconsole`
  * `db_import [path to the file saved in the previous step]
