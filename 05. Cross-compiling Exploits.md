* Usually, explit code will be developed in C/C++/C# --> Therefore there is a need to compile the exploit code into a Portable Execuatble (PE) or binary
* **What is Cross-compiling**
  * The process of compiling code for a platform other than the one performing the compilation
 
* PRACTICAL
* **Windows Exploit**
  * Eg: VideoLAN VLC Media player exploit written in C.
  * Require a tool --> MinGW-w64
  * `sudo apt-get install mingw-w64`
  * C compiler GCC install --> 
  * `sudo apt-get install gcc`
  * ***
  * `searchsploit VideoLAN VLC SMB`
  * `searchsploit -m 9303`
  * `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 9303.c -o exploit` --> Compile into a 64-bit exploit
  * `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc 9303.c -o exploit -lws2_32` --> Compile into a 32-bit exploit
 
* **Linux Exploit**
  * Eg: DirtyCow
  * `searchsploit -m 40839`
  * `gcc -pthread 40839.c -o exploit -lcrypt`
