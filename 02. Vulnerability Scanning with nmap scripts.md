## Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)
* Allows users to write and share simple scripts to automate a variety of networking tasks.
* **Where are nmap scripts stored**
  * `ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/` --> All the nmap scripts
  * `nmap -sV --script=[name of the script] [IP]`
  * Path of the script is not required unless I am running my own script.
  * These scripts were created using Lua.
  * **Description of a script**
    * `nano /usr/share/nmap/scripts/[Name of the script with extension]`
   ***
  * `ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep [Keyword to find in the scripts returned by the ls command]`
  * **Shellshock**
    * If the target is running a CGI script, Shellshock can exploit the vulnerability in CGI scripts.
    * Malicious HTTP headers can be passed to the CGI scripts.
    * `nmap -sV -p 80 --script=http-shellshock --script-args "http-shellshock.uri=/gettime.cgi" [IP]`
