* FTP server is linked to Microsoft IIS.
* If Microsoft ftpd is detected, first thing to check is if FTP allows anonymous access.
* If not allowed, go for a brute-force attack with Hydra.
* After getting access, we can write a payload in the form of asp file
* So generate msfvenom to generate a payload to then get a reverse shell.
* Then use the credentials obtained earlier with hydra to start an FTP server on the target
* And then `put payload.aspx`
* Then start a handler on attacker's machine
* And then execute payload.aspx on the target.

* **Change text of the website**
  * In FTP connection, `get index.html`
  * `vim index.html`
  * Modify the file --> `:wq`
  * Then again in FTP connection, `put index.html`
  * If website refreshed, it should show the modifications
