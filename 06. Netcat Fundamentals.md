## Netcat aka TCP/IP Swiss Army Knife
* A networking utility used to read and write data to netwrok connections using TCP or UDP.
* Netcat is available for *nix and Windows OS.
* **How does it work**
  * Netcat utilizes a client-server communication architecture with two modes:
    * **Client mode**
    * It is used in client mode to connect to any TCP/UDP port as well as a Netcat listener (Server)
    * **Server mode**
    * It can be used to listen for connections from clients on a specific port
   
* **Uses of Netcat**
  * Banner grabbing
  * Port scanning
  * Transferring files
  * Bind/Reverse shells
 
* PRACTICAL
* **Netcat on Linux** 
 * `man nc`
 
 * Where can we find netcat if it comes pre-packed on Linux system
  * `ls -al /usr/share/windows-binaries/` --> under the name nc.exe

* nc.exe does not come pre-packed with Windows So to transfer it to the Windows system, we can start a server on Linux and then download it on the Windows system
 * `python -m SimpleHTTP Server 80`
 * On Windows:
  * `certutil -urlcache -f http://[IP of the linux system]/nc.exe nc.exe`

* **Setup a listener on the TCP port**
 * It doesn't matter where we setup our listener on, could be either Linux or Windows
 * `nc -nvlp [Any free port like 1234]`
 * -n = No DNS resolution,, -v = Verbose output,, -l = listener,, -p = port number
 * Connect to the listener
 * `nc -nv [Target IP] [port specified for the listener]`
 * Type message and listener will listen on the other machine

* **Setup a listener on UDP port**
 * `nc -nvlup [port]`
 * On the other machine:
 * `nc -nvu [Target IP] [port specified for the listener]`
 * Type message and listener will listen on the other machine
* **Transfer files with Netcat**
 * Where to setup the listener: on the machine which is receiving the files
 *  On the receiver end:
 *  `nc.exe -nvlp [free port] > [name of file in which content is saved with extension]`
 *  On the sender's end:
 *  `vim test.txt`
 *  Add text
 *  `nc -nv [Target IP] [port of the listener] < [filename, could be text, executable,etc.]`
