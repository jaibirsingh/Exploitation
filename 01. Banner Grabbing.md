### Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) 
* Provides the framework to define the steps of a penetration test.

## Banner Grabbing
* It is an information gathering technique to enumerate inofrmation regarding the target OS and the services running on its open ports
* Eg: nmap scan can be used to perform banner grabbing
* Can also be done through:
  * Connecting to the open port with Netcat.
  * Authenticating with the service (if the service supports authentication). Eg: SSH, FTP, Telent,etc.
 
* **Banner grabbing with nmap**
  * ls -al /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ | grep banner
  * Here's a breakdown of the components:
      * ls: Stands for "list." It's a command used to list files and directories in a specified location.
      * -al: These are options or flags that modify the behavior of the ls command:
          * -a: Shows all files, including hidden ones (those starting with a dot .).
          * -l: Outputs the information in a detailed long listing format, displaying additional information like permissions, ownership, size, and modification date of files.
      * | grep banner: This part uses the pipe symbol |, which takes the output from the previous command and feeds it as input to another command (grep in this case). Here's what grep does:
          * grep: It's a command-line utility for searching plain-text data for lines that match a specified pattern.
          * banner: It's a pattern that grep will search for within the output of the ls command. In this context, it filters the output to only show lines containing the word "banner."
       
* **Banner grabbing with Netcat**
  * `whatis nc`
  * `man nc` --> Manual
  * `nc [Target IP]` --> In case nmap is not working.
  * `nc -v [Target IP] [port number]` --> Enable verbose output with Netcat.
  * Now we can search for the vulnerabilities and exploits for these services
  * `searchsploit [service_name with version]`
